# EntertainmentWeb
## Project Description 

EntertainmentWeb is an web application that allows a user to review some of the most popular movies. The movie selection data is pulled using the IMDB movie database, allowing the user to choose to review a movie from a large selection. The tool also includes a section where the user can find out what to watch by getting a random recommended movie with an associated random review. Search functionality has also been implemented into the tool to allow for an easier user experience when looking for other reviews.
